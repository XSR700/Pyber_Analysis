## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
Pyber is a ride sharing app used across the country. This analysis aims to improve Pyber's ride sharing services by illustrating and describing the data devided by city types. This analysis uses Python scripts with Pandas library and Matplotlib through Jupyter Notebook.
